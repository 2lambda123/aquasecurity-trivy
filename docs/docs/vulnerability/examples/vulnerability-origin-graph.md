# Analyzing origins of vulnerable dependencies

Modern software development relies on use of third-party libraries. Third party dependencies are also depends on others so list of dependencies can be represented as dependencies graph. 
In most cases vulnerable dependencies are not linked directly and it requires analyses of the tree. To make this task more simple trivy includes vulnerable origin graph.

## Table

In table output it looks like:

```
Vulnerability origin graph:
===========================
package-lock.json
├── node-fetch@1.7.3
│   └── isomorphic-fetch@2.2.1
│       └── fbjs@0.8.18
│           └── styled-components@3.1.3
└── sanitize-html@1.20.0
```

Top level of the graph is vulnerable libraries. Lower levels are to show how those vulnerabilities were imported. In the example above **sanitize-html@1.20.0** included in project directly and **node-fetch@1.7.3** is included through chain of dependencies that is added with **styled-components@3.1.3**.  (**styled-components@3.1.3** depends on **fbjs@0.8.18** and it in turn depends on **isomorphic-fetch@2.2.1**)

          "PkgParents": [

                  "Parents": [
                    {
                      "ID": "styled-components@3.1.3"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ],

```

        As of May 2022 the feature is supported for `npm` dependency parser only
