Trivy supports four file types of Node JS: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `yarn.lock`. 
The following table provides an outline of the features Trivy offers.

| File              | Transitive dependencies | Dev dependencies | Dependency graph | Position | License |
|-------------------|:-----------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| package.json      |            -            |     Exclude      |        -         |    -     |    ✅    |
| package-lock.json |            ✅            |     Exclude      |        ✅         |    ✅     |    -    |
| pnpm-lock.yaml    |            ✅            |     Exclude      |        ✅         |    -     |    -    |
| yarn.lock         |            ✅            |     Exclude      |        ✅         |    ✅     |    -    |

## package.json

`package.json` files contains range of versions for dependencies, so we can't properly parse dependencies for those files.

Trivy only finds package name, version and license for those packages.

!!! note
    Trivy skips `node_modules` folders when scanning `package.json` files.

## package-lock.json

Trivy finds production dependencies, their position (line numbers) and can build [graph] for dependencies containing vulnerabilities.

## pnpm-lock.yaml

Trivy finds production dependencies and can build [graph] for dependencies containing vulnerabilities.

## yarn.lock
`yarn.lock` files don't contain information about developer dependencies. 
To get only production dependencies `package.json` also needs to be present next to `yarn.lock`.
