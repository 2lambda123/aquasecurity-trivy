Trivy supports [Composer Dependency Manager][composer]. The following table provides an outline of the features Trivy offers.


| File          | Transitive dependencies | Dev dependencies | Dependency graph | Position | License |
|---------------|:-----------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| composer.lock |            ✅            |     Excluded     |        ✅         |    ✅     |    ✅    |

## Composer.lock

`composer.lock` files don't contain information about direct dependencies. To find direct dependencies and build the correct dependency graph, `composer.json` also needs to be present next to `composer.lock`.
