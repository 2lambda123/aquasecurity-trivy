# PHP

Trivy supports [Composer][composer], which is a tool for dependency management in PHP.
The following table provides an outline of the features Trivy offers.


| Package Manager | File           | Transitive dependencies | Dev dependencies | Dependency graph | Position | License |
|-----------------|----------------|:-----------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| Composer        | composer.lock  |            ✅            |     Excluded     |        ✅         |    ✅     |    ✅    |
| Composer        | installed.json |            ✅            |     Excluded     |        -         |    ✅     |    ✅    |

## composer.lock
In order to detect dependencies, Trivy searches for `composer.lock`.

Trivy also supports dependency trees; however, to display an accurate tree, it needs to know whether each package is a direct dependency of the project.
Since this information is not included in `composer.lock`, Trivy parses `composer.json`, which should be located next to `composer.lock`.
If you want to see the dependency tree, please ensure that `composer.json` is present.

## installed.json
Trivy also supports dependency detection for `installed.json` files. By default, you can find this file at `path_to_app/vendor/composer/installed.json`.
