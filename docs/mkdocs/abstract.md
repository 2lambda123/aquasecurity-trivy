`Trivy` (`tri` pronounced like **tri**gger, `vy` pronounced like en**vy**) is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts.
A software vulnerability is a glitch, flaw, or weakness present in the software or in an Operating System.
`Trivy` detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and application dependencies (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.).
`Trivy` is easy to use. Just install the binary and you're ready to scan. All you need to do for scanning is to specify a target such as an image name of the container.

It is considered to be used in CI. Before pushing to a container registry or deploying your application, you can scan your local container image and other artifacts easily.
